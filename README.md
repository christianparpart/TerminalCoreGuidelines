# Terminal Core Guidelines

This repository is an attempt to collect all terminal control sequences,
nicely categorized and well documented for the modern world post year 2020.

The VT sequences will by far not be complete in terms of what VT terminal emulators could do back in
year 1980s. But that is the goal, to lift the burden for everyone who wants to dive into the world
of terminals by not forcing them to read through a lot of outdated, artificially kept alive
documentation where it is hard as newcomer to know what is important tor ead and what is not.

This repository attempts to collect all important information into one single space.
